## Problem Statement

The field of data professions is growing rapidly, but understanding global trends in salaries, job satisfaction, and entry difficulty remains challenging. This project aims to analyze a professional survey of data professionals across various countries, providing insights into salary averages, preferred programming languages, and overall job satisfaction. The goal is to help stakeholders better understand the current landscape of the data profession.


### Steps followed 

- Data Preparation:

    Loaded survey data from 500+ data professionals across multiple countries.
    Grouped countries into "major" countries and an "others" category for smaller nations.
- Visualization Design:

    Created a Treemap to visualize country-wise distribution of survey respondents. The map allows users to click on a particular country and view detailed information for that country. Added a few slicers and cards along with gauges, piecharts and stacked bar and column charts.
- Salary Analysis:

    Calculated the average salaries for each profession and presented them in an easy-to-read format for comparison.
- Difficulty Level Analysis:

    Analyzed the responses regarding the difficulty level of breaking into data professions. This helped determine which professions have higher barriers to entry.
- Programming Language Popularity:

    Visualized the popularity of programming languages among respondents to identify the most commonly used languages in the data profession.
- Demographics Analysis:

    Calculated the average age of participants to provide an understanding of the age distribution in data professions.
- Satisfaction Rating:

    Analyzed respondentsâ€™ satisfaction with their salary and work-life balance by calculating average satisfaction scores, helping highlight areas of improvement for organizations.
